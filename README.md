# ORC: Open Reservoir Computing

[![CI](https://github.com/dtretiak/OpenReservoirComputing/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dtretiak/OpenReservoirComputing/actions/workflows/tests.yml)


ORC is the one-stop-shop for performant reservoir computing in jax. Key high-level features include
- Modular design for mixing and matching layers and reservoir drivers (or creating your own!)
- Continuous, discrete, serial, and parallel implementations
- Built in hyperparameter tuning
